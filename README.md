# Academic projects
The current repository showcases the projects I've worked on throughout my second year in CFGS ASIR. 
<br>
The purpose of the repository is to showcase my skills, organization, documentation, writing prowes and knowledge. The documents are in Spanish, since that's the languague used in the institution where I studied. 

I do not allow the distribution of my work, only its use for educational purposes.
