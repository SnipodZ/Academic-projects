# Academic projects
The current repository showcases the projects I've worked on throughout my second year in CFGS ASIR. First year is not included, some exceptions applied, due to the simplicity of the projects.

The purpose of the repository is to showcase my skills, organization, documentation, writing prowes and knowledge. The documents are in Spanish, since that's the languague used in the institution where I studied. 

I do not allow the distribution of my work, only its use for educational purposes.
